# This draws a resizeable triangle and allows one to draw points
# which are being colored in red if they are outside the triangle, green otherwise.
#
# In contrary to the suggested solution this does not clear the objects when resizing
# the triangle but rechecks whether they are inside the triangle after draggine the triangle.
# Avoiding that a point is being drawn when the triangle is dragged is realized by
# drawing the point when releasing the mouse button and only if the mouse was not moved in-between

def is_inside(point, triangle):
    ''' Tests whether a point is contained in a triangle
        specified by an array of points.
        The point and the points in the triangle must have
        a vector semantic (for example array() from numpy)
        and a dot-product must be defined (for example dot() from numpy).
        Calculation is done by specifying a coordinate transformation and
        then reversing it. The new coordination system is defined by
        the AB and AC axis of the triangle and the point A as an offet.
        A point which is inside must then have coords > 0 and must be
        smaller than 1 in the 1-norm.

        Any point can be written as P = A + u(B-A) + v(C-A)
        which is equivalent to P-A = u(B-A) + v(C-A).
        Applying once the dot-product with B-A and once with C-A
        yields two equations which can then be solved for u,v
